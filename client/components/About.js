          This is a project that I made to learn more about GraphQL, Relay, and
          ReactJS. I was not built this project from zero cause I dont know yet
          how, and for this reason, Im thinking about writing a long tutorial
          about GraphQL and Relay in my blog to explain everything that I
          learning. This project and my future articles that I will write is too
          to help me for applying to <a href="https://entria.com.br/">Entria</a>
        </p>
      </div>
    </>
  );
